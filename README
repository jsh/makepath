Write a shell function named makepath that, given a pathname, creates all
components in that pathname as directories.  For example, the command
makepath a/b/c/d should create directories a, a/b, a/b/c, and a/b/c/d.
(THe mkdir -p command creates directories in this manner.  Solve the
problem without using the without using mkdir -p.)
